Webpage CV. Modification on a fork of https://github.com/sharu725/online-cv
You can see all the original authors and settings in that repository. I use that as a base code for my version (since I wanted to modify the display of the fields). For now is very personal (I priorize my actual requires over the reusability of code) and it is not "friendly forkable" like the original.
